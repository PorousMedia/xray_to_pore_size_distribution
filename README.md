The notebook demonstrates the workflow for obtaining pore size distribution from binarized micro-CT images. The general principle involves identifying each pore, estimating the volume of each pore, and ultimately determining the radius of a sphere with an equivalent volume of each pore. There is also an option to analyse the sample to see if it is representative.
